## Stone 6 — Final feature integration

**You will have:** A new attendance instance builds its known tenant schedule without querying identity_org tables; duplicate snapshot is harmless.

### W03-S31 — Publish organization facts through owner intent — state the failing behavior (30–30 min)

**Why:** B owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/KAFKA-BASICS.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `mobile/test/publishorganizationfactsthroughownerintent_test.dart`, `web/test/publishorganizationfactsthroughownerintent.test.ts`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Inspect first and repeat the golden slice. Write one failing assertion for this existing objective: Write organization fact and owner outbox in one transaction, using the existing Avro starter shape. Publish to Kafka before marking sent; keep a repeatable tenant-scoped snapshot bootstrap for a new attendance consumer. Use the current HTTP/JDBC/client fixture, fixed clock and synthetic tenant; make the test fail for behavior, not missing imports. Add this behavior to the week runner on its first use.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
npm --prefix web run test -- --run
# From the confirmed Flutter root:
flutter test
```

**Expect:** The behavior assertion fails on the documented missing behavior. Target after green: Rollback leaves no fact/intent; publish acknowledgment precedes mark-sent; snapshot has tenant and revision.

```text
Red: expected behavior assertion fails; build/setup errors are diagnosed separately.
Green: Failures: 0, Errors: 0; negative assertion prevents the forbidden effect.
```

**Common mistake:** Treating a missing environment/class as the intended failing behavior.

**Undo:** For this isolated un-deployed commit run `git revert HEAD`. Applied SQL/data needs a new forward migration or the reviewed [rollback/restore procedure](../runbooks/ROLLBACK.md); Git does not reverse data. For temporary read-only findings this reverses only their recorded commit.

**Senior habit:** Write the failing assertion before changing production behavior.

**Check:**

- [ ] This result and its stated denial/failure assertion have real report evidence; red commits stay untagged.
- [ ] Committed with message `feat(w03): w03-s31` for implementation or `docs(w03): w03-s31` for findings/evidence, with exact reviewed paths only.

**If it fails:** Save the exact failed assertion or prerequisite; use [week troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and the [stuck protocol](../STUCK-PROTOCOL.md). Stop at the stated cap, keep the next smallest repair visible and spend only reserved recovery time. Security/data/restore failures cannot be waived.

**Status:** **Not run**; proposed implementation has not been executed by this documentation upgrade.

### W03-S32 — Publish organization facts through owner intent — make the narrow behavior pass (45–45 min)

**Why:** B owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/KAFKA-BASICS.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `mobile/lib/features/publishorganizationfactsthroughownerintent.dart`, `web/app/pages/publishorganizationfactsthroughownerintent.vue`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Repeat the golden slice with this delta only: Write organization fact and owner outbox in one transaction, using the existing Avro starter shape. Publish to Kafka before marking sent; keep a repeatable tenant-scoped snapshot bootstrap for a new attendance consumer. Make the preceding behavior assertion green; use existing validation/problem/auth/tenant adapters. If more than three files are needed, take the next smallest adapter first and record the remaining delta, keeping the stone untagged until complete.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
npm --prefix web run test -- --run
# From the confirmed Flutter root:
flutter test
```

**Expect:** Rollback leaves no fact/intent; publish acknowledgment precedes mark-sent; snapshot has tenant and revision.

```text
Red: expected behavior assertion fails; build/setup errors are diagnosed separately.
Green: Failures: 0, Errors: 0; negative assertion prevents the forbidden effect.
```

**Common mistake:** Tagging or deploying before this behavior and its negative check pass.

**Undo:** For this isolated un-deployed commit run `git revert HEAD`. Applied SQL/data needs a new forward migration or the reviewed [rollback/restore procedure](../runbooks/ROLLBACK.md); Git does not reverse data. For temporary read-only findings this reverses only their recorded commit.

**Senior habit:** Make the smallest tested change and reuse the shared contract.

**Check:**

- [ ] This result and its stated denial/failure assertion have real report evidence; red commits stay untagged.
- [ ] Committed with message `feat(w03): w03-s32` for implementation or `docs(w03): w03-s32` for findings/evidence, with exact reviewed paths only.

**If it fails:** Save the exact failed assertion or prerequisite; use [week troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and the [stuck protocol](../STUCK-PROTOCOL.md). Stop at the stated cap, keep the next smallest repair visible and spend only reserved recovery time. Security/data/restore failures cannot be waived.

**Status:** **Not run**; proposed implementation has not been executed by this documentation upgrade.

### W03-S33 — Publish organization facts through owner intent — prove the denied or failure path (30–30 min)

**Why:** B owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/KAFKA-BASICS.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `mobile/test/publishorganizationfactsthroughownerintent_test.dart`, `web/test/publishorganizationfactsthroughownerintent.test.ts`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Repeat the golden slice with the failure delta: Rollback leaves no fact/intent; publish acknowledgment precedes mark-sent; snapshot has tenant and revision. Add this one negative/race assertion to the current feature fixture; assert no forbidden row/effect or leaked bytes. Fix only the proven minimal defect and rerun its red/green tests.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
npm --prefix web run test -- --run
# From the confirmed Flutter root:
flutter test
```

**Expect:** Rollback leaves no fact/intent; publish acknowledgment precedes mark-sent; snapshot has tenant and revision.

```text
Red: expected behavior assertion fails; build/setup errors are diagnosed separately.
Green: Failures: 0, Errors: 0; negative assertion prevents the forbidden effect.
```

**Common mistake:** Asserting an error without checking that no forbidden row/effect escaped.

**Undo:** For this isolated un-deployed commit run `git revert HEAD`. Applied SQL/data needs a new forward migration or the reviewed [rollback/restore procedure](../runbooks/ROLLBACK.md); Git does not reverse data. For temporary read-only findings this reverses only their recorded commit.

**Senior habit:** Test denial and rollback as carefully as the happy path.

**Check:**

- [ ] This result and its stated denial/failure assertion have real report evidence; red commits stay untagged.
- [ ] Committed with message `feat(w03): w03-s33` for implementation or `docs(w03): w03-s33` for findings/evidence, with exact reviewed paths only.

**If it fails:** Save the exact failed assertion or prerequisite; use [week troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and the [stuck protocol](../STUCK-PROTOCOL.md). Stop at the stated cap, keep the next smallest repair visible and spend only reserved recovery time. Security/data/restore failures cannot be waived.

**Status:** **Not run**; proposed implementation has not been executed by this documentation upgrade.

### W03-S34 — Verify RLS role grants and pool reuse (45–45 min)

**Why:** B owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/ROW-LEVEL-SECURITY.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `services/identity-org/src/main/java/com/hrflow/identityorg/application/RlsRoleService.java`, `services/identity-org/src/main/java/com/hrflow/identityorg/infrastructure/RlsRoleRepository.java`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Repeat the golden slice; required quality delta: Add real PostgreSQL assertions using non-owner runtime role: missing context, WITH CHECK denial, pool A/B reuse and rollback. Keep migration role separate.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
mvn -pl services/identity-org -am test
```

**Expect:** All RLS negatives fail closed; test run as schema owner is rejected as invalid evidence.

```text
Red: expected behavior assertion fails; build/setup errors are diagnosed separately.
Green: Failures: 0, Errors: 0; negative assertion prevents the forbidden effect.
```

**Common mistake:** Calling a command invocation proof without inspecting the recorded assertion/output.

**Undo:** For this isolated un-deployed commit run `git revert HEAD`. Applied SQL/data needs a new forward migration or the reviewed [rollback/restore procedure](../runbooks/ROLLBACK.md); Git does not reverse data. For temporary read-only findings this reverses only their recorded commit.

**Senior habit:** Keep a reproducible evidence trail and a safe rollback boundary.

**Check:**

- [ ] This result and its stated denial/failure assertion have real report evidence; red commits stay untagged.
- [ ] Committed with message `feat(w03): w03-s34` for implementation or `docs(w03): w03-s34` for findings/evidence, with exact reviewed paths only.

**If it fails:** Save the exact failed assertion or prerequisite; use [week troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and the [stuck protocol](../STUCK-PROTOCOL.md). Stop at the stated cap, keep the next smallest repair visible and spend only reserved recovery time. Security/data/restore failures cannot be waived.

**Status:** **Not run**; proposed implementation has not been executed by this documentation upgrade.

### W03-S35 — Bootstrap organization facts for attendance (45–45 min)

**Why:** A owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/KAFKA-BASICS.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `services/attendance/src/main/java/com/hrflow/attendance/application/OrganizationBootstrapService.java`, `services/attendance/src/main/java/com/hrflow/attendance/infrastructure/OrganizationBootstrapRepository.java`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Repeat the golden slice; required quality delta: Create attendance-owned org/site/shift/holiday projections and a Kafka consumer with inbox/revision guard. Bootstrap from the Week-3 org snapshot, gate readiness until complete; reuse the owner publisher built this week.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
mvn -pl services/attendance -am test
```

**Expect:** A new attendance instance builds its known tenant schedule without querying identity_org tables; duplicate snapshot is harmless.

```text
Red: expected behavior assertion fails; build/setup errors are diagnosed separately.
Green: Failures: 0, Errors: 0; negative assertion prevents the forbidden effect.
```

**Common mistake:** Calling a command invocation proof without inspecting the recorded assertion/output.

**Undo:** For this isolated un-deployed commit run `git revert HEAD`. Applied SQL/data needs a new forward migration or the reviewed [rollback/restore procedure](../runbooks/ROLLBACK.md); Git does not reverse data. For temporary read-only findings this reverses only their recorded commit.

**Senior habit:** Keep a reproducible evidence trail and a safe rollback boundary.

**Check:**

- [ ] This result and its stated denial/failure assertion have real report evidence; red commits stay untagged.
- [ ] Committed with message `feat(w03): w03-s35` for implementation or `docs(w03): w03-s35` for findings/evidence, with exact reviewed paths only.
- [ ] Tagged `w03-s35-green` after the [ten-minute review](../CODE-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md), all stone assertions and current private app startup pass; never overwrite an old tag.

**If it fails:** Save the exact failed assertion or prerequisite; use [week troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and the [stuck protocol](../STUCK-PROTOCOL.md). Stop at the stated cap, keep the next smallest repair visible and spend only reserved recovery time. Security/data/restore failures cannot be waived.

**Status:** **Not run**; proposed implementation has not been executed by this documentation upgrade.
