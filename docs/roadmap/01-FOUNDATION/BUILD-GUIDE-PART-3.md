## Stone 3 — Contract and client fixtures

**You will have:** Rejected input/rolled-back insert changes zero committed rows; all identity tests pass.

### W01-S13 — Drive the mock from the one contract (45–45 min)

**Why:** B owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/OPENAPI.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `contracts/openapi.yaml`, `mobile/test/department_contract_test.dart`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Inspect the actual mobile root and pinned mock/validator from W01-S09. Start its local mock from the sole OpenAPI file, then make the Flutter fixture test assert the documented department response. Do not create a second independent mock schema. Start the already locked mock with docs/validation/node_modules/.bin/prism mock contracts/openapi.yaml on loopback; stop it after fixtures.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
git diff --stat
```

**Expect:** Only the contract fixture and client test change; mock returns documented 201 fields and the client assertion passes.

```text
Evidence: exact command, exit code, safe result line and report path.
Missing target/prerequisite: BLOCKED; never a fabricated successful result.
```

**Common mistake:** Calling a command invocation proof without inspecting the recorded assertion/output.

**Undo:** For this isolated un-deployed commit run `git revert HEAD`. Applied SQL/data needs a new forward migration or the reviewed [rollback/restore procedure](../runbooks/ROLLBACK.md); Git does not reverse data. For temporary read-only findings this reverses only their recorded commit.

**Senior habit:** Keep a reproducible evidence trail and a safe rollback boundary.

**Check:**

- [ ] This result and its stated denial/failure assertion have real report evidence; red commits stay untagged.
- [ ] Committed with message `feat(w01): w01-s13` for implementation or `docs(w01): w01-s13` for findings/evidence, with exact reviewed paths only.

**If it fails:** Save the exact failed assertion or prerequisite; use [week troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and the [stuck protocol](../STUCK-PROTOCOL.md). Stop at the stated cap, keep the next smallest repair visible and spend only reserved recovery time. Security/data/restore failures cannot be waived.

**Status:** **Not run**; proposed implementation has not been executed by this documentation upgrade.

### W01-S14 — Show one contract failure in both clients (30–30 min)

**Why:** B owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/PROBLEM-DETAILS.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `web/app/app.vue`, `mobile/test/department_contract_test.dart`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Repeat the golden slice with delta: invalid department fixture returns the documented problem code; both clients display safe detail and preserve input. Verify no technical stack or token is rendered.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
npm --prefix web run build
```

**Expect:** Nuxt build and selected Flutter test pass; invalid fixture displays VALIDATION_FAILED with no stack trace.

```text
Evidence: exact command, exit code, safe result line and report path.
Missing target/prerequisite: BLOCKED; never a fabricated successful result.
```

**Common mistake:** Calling a command invocation proof without inspecting the recorded assertion/output.

**Undo:** For this isolated un-deployed commit run `git revert HEAD`. Applied SQL/data needs a new forward migration or the reviewed [rollback/restore procedure](../runbooks/ROLLBACK.md); Git does not reverse data. For temporary read-only findings this reverses only their recorded commit.

**Senior habit:** Keep a reproducible evidence trail and a safe rollback boundary.

**Check:**

- [ ] This result and its stated denial/failure assertion have real report evidence; red commits stay untagged.
- [ ] Committed with message `feat(w01): w01-s14` for implementation or `docs(w01): w01-s14` for findings/evidence, with exact reviewed paths only.

**If it fails:** Save the exact failed assertion or prerequisite; use [week troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and the [stuck protocol](../STUCK-PROTOCOL.md). Stop at the stated cap, keep the next smallest repair visible and spend only reserved recovery time. Security/data/restore failures cannot be waived.

**Status:** **Not run**; proposed implementation has not been executed by this documentation upgrade.

### W01-S15 — Add the shared problem contract to identity (45–45 min)

**Why:** A owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/PROBLEM-DETAILS.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `services/identity-org/src/main/java/com/hrflow/identityorg/api/ApiProblemHandler.java`, `services/identity-org/src/test/java/com/hrflow/identityorg/api/ApiProblemHandlerTest.java`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Inspect first: locate any error advice. If absent use these proposed paths. Write a failing validation/error assertion, then return the golden problem shape with a stable code/traceId and application/problem+json. Keep unknown exceptions sanitized.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
mvn -f services/identity-org/pom.xml test
```

**Expect:** Validation and unexpected-error tests assert content type and standard members, with no exception/stack in the response.

```text
Evidence: exact command, exit code, safe result line and report path.
Missing target/prerequisite: BLOCKED; never a fabricated successful result.
```

**Common mistake:** Calling a command invocation proof without inspecting the recorded assertion/output.

**Undo:** For this isolated un-deployed commit run `git revert HEAD`. Applied SQL/data needs a new forward migration or the reviewed [rollback/restore procedure](../runbooks/ROLLBACK.md); Git does not reverse data. For temporary read-only findings this reverses only their recorded commit.

**Status:** **Not run**; proposed implementation has not been executed by this documentation upgrade.

### W01-S16 — Match the reactive gateway error shape (30–30 min)

**Why:** A owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/REACTIVE-GATEWAY.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `services/api-gateway/src/main/java/com/hrflow/gateway/ApiProblemWriter.java`, `services/api-gateway/src/test/java/com/hrflow/gateway/ApiProblemWriterTest.java`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Inspect the actual reactive error hooks selected by W01-S07; write the equivalent problem body for a denied/unroutable request. Reuse wire fixtures; do not copy MVC advice into WebFlux.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
mvn -f services/api-gateway/pom.xml test
```

**Expect:** Reactive error test matches the same problem fields and never serializes a stack trace.

```text
Evidence: exact command, exit code, safe result line and report path.
Missing target/prerequisite: BLOCKED; never a fabricated successful result.
```

**Common mistake:** Calling a command invocation proof without inspecting the recorded assertion/output.

**Undo:** For this isolated un-deployed commit run `git revert HEAD`. Applied SQL/data needs a new forward migration or the reviewed [rollback/restore procedure](../runbooks/ROLLBACK.md); Git does not reverse data. For temporary read-only findings this reverses only their recorded commit.

**Status:** **Not run**; proposed implementation has not been executed by this documentation upgrade.

### W01-S17 — Register the negative contract examples (30–30 min)

**Why:** B owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/CONTRACT-TESTS.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `contracts/openapi.yaml`, `docs/validation/W01-EVIDENCE.md`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Add the exact tested validation and sanitized-500 examples to the sole contract. Run its pinned validator and compare client fixtures; record the command/output instead of claiming an unused schema is checked.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
git diff -- contracts/openapi.yaml
```

**Expect:** Examples include stable codes and no secrets; validator and fixture assertions pass.

```text
Evidence: exact command, exit code, safe result line and report path.
Missing target/prerequisite: BLOCKED; never a fabricated successful result.
```

### W01-S18 — Prove failures cannot create diagnostic data (45–45 min)

**Why:** A owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/TEST-FIRST.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `services/identity-org/src/test/java/com/hrflow/identityorg/DiagnosticDatabaseTest.java`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Extend the existing disposable PostgreSQL test with invalid insert and rollback assertions. A failed transaction must leave its original row count unchanged. Run the assertion red before the minimum fix if a defect is found.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
mvn -f services/identity-org/pom.xml test
```

**Expect:** Rejected input/rolled-back insert changes zero committed rows; all identity tests pass.

```text
Evidence: exact command, exit code, safe result line and report path.
Missing target/prerequisite: BLOCKED; never a fabricated successful result.
```

**Common mistake:** Calling a command invocation proof without inspecting the recorded assertion/output.

**Undo:** For this isolated un-deployed commit run `git revert HEAD`. Applied SQL/data needs a new forward migration or the reviewed [rollback/restore procedure](../runbooks/ROLLBACK.md); Git does not reverse data. For temporary read-only findings this reverses only their recorded commit.

**Check:**

- [ ] This result and its stated denial/failure assertion have real report evidence; red commits stay untagged.
- [ ] Committed with message `feat(w01): w01-s18` for implementation or `docs(w01): w01-s18` for findings/evidence, with exact reviewed paths only.
- [ ] Tagged `w01-s18-green` after the [ten-minute review](../CODE-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md), all stone assertions and current private app startup pass; never overwrite an old tag.

**If it fails:** Save the exact failed assertion or prerequisite; use [week troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and the [stuck protocol](../STUCK-PROTOCOL.md). Stop at the stated cap, keep the next smallest repair visible and spend only reserved recovery time. Security/data/restore failures cannot be waived.

**Status:** **Not run**; proposed implementation has not been executed by this documentation upgrade.
