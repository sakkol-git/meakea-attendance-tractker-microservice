## Stone 6 — CI and private operational prerequisites

**You will have:** Workflow cannot report an absent image or failed scan database download as success; unresolved findings are explicit release blockers.

### W01-S30 — Write the private deploy and smoke scripts (45–45 min)

**Why:** B owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/DOCKER-COMPOSE.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `ops/deploy.sh`, `ops/selfhost-smoke.sh`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Using the deploy runbook, write fail-fast scripts that require a confirmed target, validate Compose, record prior image/config/migration IDs, start the private candidate, wait with a deadline and run readiness/denied-business-route assertions. Refuse missing backups and red artifacts. No down -v or database downgrade. Week 1 accepts the disposable diagnostic backup created next.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
bash -n ops/deploy.sh ops/selfhost-smoke.sh
```

**Expect:** Syntax exits zero; safe dry-run/refusal test rejects unknown target; no script treats a failed health response as success.

```text
Evidence: exact command, exit code, safe result line and report path.
Missing target/prerequisite: BLOCKED; never a fabricated successful result.
```

**Common mistake:** Calling a command invocation proof without inspecting the recorded assertion/output.

**Undo:** For this isolated un-deployed commit run `git revert HEAD`. Applied SQL/data needs a new forward migration or the reviewed [rollback/restore procedure](../runbooks/ROLLBACK.md); Git does not reverse data. For temporary read-only findings this reverses only their recorded commit.

**Senior habit:** Keep a reproducible evidence trail and a safe rollback boundary.

**Check:**

- [ ] This result and its stated denial/failure assertion have real report evidence; red commits stay untagged.
- [ ] Committed with message `feat(w01): w01-s30` for implementation or `docs(w01): w01-s30` for findings/evidence, with exact reviewed paths only.

**If it fails:** Save the exact failed assertion or prerequisite; use [week troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and the [stuck protocol](../STUCK-PROTOCOL.md). Stop at the stated cap, keep the next smallest repair visible and spend only reserved recovery time. Security/data/restore failures cannot be waived.

**Status:** **Not run**; proposed implementation has not been executed by this documentation upgrade.

### W01-S31 — Write and prove the disposable restore pair (45–45 min)

**Why:** B owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/BACKUPS-RESTORES.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `ops/backup.sh`, `ops/restore-scratch.sh`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Create fail-fast custom pg_dump/restore scripts using the restore runbook. Week 1 mode permits only disposable diagnostic DB and local private output; require explicit scratch target, verify archive/list/row count and original DB unchanged. Production mode stays blocked until Week 2 external mount/file/schema inventory. Never delete the only backup.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
bash -n ops/backup.sh ops/restore-scratch.sh
```

**Expect:** Syntax passes; scratch round-trip command records one known diagnostic row and refuses a production-looking target. Shell syntax alone is not the restore result.

```text
Evidence: exact command, exit code, safe result line and report path.
Missing target/prerequisite: BLOCKED; never a fabricated successful result.
```

**Common mistake:** Calling a command invocation proof without inspecting the recorded assertion/output.

**Undo:** For this isolated un-deployed commit run `git revert HEAD`. Applied SQL/data needs a new forward migration or the reviewed [rollback/restore procedure](../runbooks/ROLLBACK.md); Git does not reverse data. For temporary read-only findings this reverses only their recorded commit.

**Senior habit:** Keep a reproducible evidence trail and a safe rollback boundary.

**Check:**

- [ ] This result and its stated denial/failure assertion have real report evidence; red commits stay untagged.
- [ ] Committed with message `feat(w01): w01-s31` for implementation or `docs(w01): w01-s31` for findings/evidence, with exact reviewed paths only.

**If it fails:** Save the exact failed assertion or prerequisite; use [week troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and the [stuck protocol](../STUCK-PROTOCOL.md). Stop at the stated cap, keep the next smallest repair visible and spend only reserved recovery time. Security/data/restore failures cannot be waived.

**Status:** **Not run**; proposed implementation has not been executed by this documentation upgrade.

### W01-S32 — Make CI execute the same checks (30–30 min)

**Why:** B owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/CI-SCANS.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `.github/workflows/verify.yml`, `docs/validation/W01-EVIDENCE.md`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Inspect first: create the proposed workflow only if no equivalent exists. Use Java 21, pinned action revisions and existing Maven/Nuxt commands plus contract/docs checks. Push to the authorized implementation work branch only; no deployment credentials.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
python3 docs/roadmap/tools/docs-lint.py docs
```

**Expect:** Workflow names actual commands; a deliberately failing test blocks CI. Local YAML existence alone is not a CI pass.

```text
Evidence: exact command, exit code, safe result line and report path.
Missing target/prerequisite: BLOCKED; never a fabricated successful result.
```

**Common mistake:** Calling a command invocation proof without inspecting the recorded assertion/output.

**Undo:** For this isolated un-deployed commit run `git revert HEAD`. Applied SQL/data needs a new forward migration or the reviewed [rollback/restore procedure](../runbooks/ROLLBACK.md); Git does not reverse data. For temporary read-only findings this reverses only their recorded commit.

**Senior habit:** Keep a reproducible evidence trail and a safe rollback boundary.

**Check:**

- [ ] This result and its stated denial/failure assertion have real report evidence; red commits stay untagged.
- [ ] Committed with message `feat(w01): w01-s32` for implementation or `docs(w01): w01-s32` for findings/evidence, with exact reviewed paths only.

**If it fails:** Save the exact failed assertion or prerequisite; use [week troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and the [stuck protocol](../STUCK-PROTOCOL.md). Stop at the stated cap, keep the next smallest repair visible and spend only reserved recovery time. Security/data/restore failures cannot be waived.

**Status:** **Not run**; proposed implementation has not been executed by this documentation upgrade.

### W01-S33 — Add a secret-scan failure fixture (30–30 min)

**Why:** B owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/CI-SCANS.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `.github/workflows/verify.yml`, `docs/validation/W01-EVIDENCE.md`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Pin Gitleaks in the existing workflow and verify it detects its documented synthetic test-secret fixture in a temporary test repository. Do not add a real secret, disable scanning or print credentials.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
git diff -- .github/workflows/verify.yml
```

**Expect:** Every push has secret scanning; the safe synthetic fixture fails and the real docs/code scan has recorded results.

```text
Evidence: exact command, exit code, safe result line and report path.
Missing target/prerequisite: BLOCKED; never a fabricated successful result.
```

**Common mistake:** Calling a command invocation proof without inspecting the recorded assertion/output.

**Undo:** For this isolated un-deployed commit run `git revert HEAD`. Applied SQL/data needs a new forward migration or the reviewed [rollback/restore procedure](../runbooks/ROLLBACK.md); Git does not reverse data. For temporary read-only findings this reverses only their recorded commit.

**Senior habit:** Keep a reproducible evidence trail and a safe rollback boundary.

**Check:**

- [ ] This result and its stated denial/failure assertion have real report evidence; red commits stay untagged.
- [ ] Committed with message `feat(w01): w01-s33` for implementation or `docs(w01): w01-s33` for findings/evidence, with exact reviewed paths only.

**If it fails:** Save the exact failed assertion or prerequisite; use [week troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and the [stuck protocol](../STUCK-PROTOCOL.md). Stop at the stated cap, keep the next smallest repair visible and spend only reserved recovery time. Security/data/restore failures cannot be waived.

**Status:** **Not run**; proposed implementation has not been executed by this documentation upgrade.

### W01-S34 — Scan dependencies and the built image (45–45 min)

**Why:** B owns one observable result in the preserved weekly objective.

**Read first (up to 10 min, included):** [One concept](../primers/CI-SCANS.md). Reuse prior learning; no new concept on Thursday/Friday.

**Before you start:**

- [ ] Earlier prerequisite result is green; an intended red assertion is isolated on the work branch. A critical failed prior gate replaces this action.

**Do:**

1. Inspect first: review current equivalents for `.github/workflows/verify.yml`, `docs/validation/W01-EVIDENCE.md`. Use those actual names; if absent these paths are explicitly proposed. Inspect and choose the next unused Flyway version before any schema change, never edit an applied migration.
1. Pin Trivy filesystem/dependency and image scans. Add the reviewed build step for the first identity image if its Dockerfile is already created; otherwise record the missing-image blocker and do not mark Q12 complete. Pin base image version/digest from registry evidence. Workflow must build identity and gateway images before scanning their recorded digests; missing image is a failing job, not a skipped scan.
1. Run the exact check below after target creation. Record the semantic assertion, command/exit and report path in this step commit; do not treat syntax/config validation as proof of deployment, recovery or broker delivery.

```bash
git diff --stat
```

**Expect:** Workflow cannot report an absent image or failed scan database download as success; unresolved findings are explicit release blockers.

```text
Evidence: exact command, exit code, safe result line and report path.
Missing target/prerequisite: BLOCKED; never a fabricated successful result.
```

**Common mistake:** Calling a command invocation proof without inspecting the recorded assertion/output.

**Undo:** For this isolated un-deployed commit run `git revert HEAD`. Applied SQL/data needs a new forward migration or the reviewed [rollback/restore procedure](../runbooks/ROLLBACK.md); Git does not reverse data. For temporary read-only findings this reverses only their recorded commit.

**Senior habit:** Keep a reproducible evidence trail and a safe rollback boundary.

**Check:**

- [ ] This result and its stated denial/failure assertion have real report evidence; red commits stay untagged.
- [ ] Committed with message `feat(w01): w01-s34` for implementation or `docs(w01): w01-s34` for findings/evidence, with exact reviewed paths only.
- [ ] Tagged `w01-s34-green` after the [ten-minute review](../CODE-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md), all stone assertions and current private app startup pass; never overwrite an old tag.

**If it fails:** Save the exact failed assertion or prerequisite; use [week troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and the [stuck protocol](../STUCK-PROTOCOL.md). Stop at the stated cap, keep the next smallest repair visible and spend only reserved recovery time. Security/data/restore failures cannot be waived.

**Status:** **Not run**; proposed implementation has not been executed by this documentation upgrade.
